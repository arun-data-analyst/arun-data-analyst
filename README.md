# 👋 Hi, I’m Arun Acharya (@arun-data-analyst)

## **Data Analyst | Healthcare Focus | Equity Advocate**

I’m a data analyst with a broad skill set in cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets — but my passion lies in **healthcare and public health analytics**.  
I believe numbers are not just statistics; they are stories of people. My work is driven by the goal of making healthcare data **actionable**, helping decision-makers close gaps in equity, and becoming a **voice for those whose struggles are hidden in the data**.  

With each project, I aim to turn raw data into insights that can inform fairer policies, improve outcomes, and highlight the inequities that demand attention.
